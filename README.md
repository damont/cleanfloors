Roomba Wannabe

The project used TIs LaunchPad development board to drive a bot, creating a map of the area it has traversed.
The bot was then able to retrace its steps when prompted.

Its still a long ways away, but if you would like more information on the technical details or the 
schematic layout of the board/motors/motor drivers/bumper please let me know and I will work to get them
for you.
